while the code was functional I tried multiple ways to move my classes to a seprate file to keep the main.cpp clean but I ran into the same issue no matter what, that was that I was not allowed to create my linkedList in my IDE this caused me to just have to dump it in the main. I know this is not submission guidlines so I attached some files showing my attempts with moving the class decloration to another file, and this was done many many more ways than the attached images these just highlight some of the ways I attmpted to move them. The ultimate issue I faced is that it would not attach that portion from functions.h. 

When running the code no input should be needed and the documention for the functions are commented. To change the numbers simply use the main and adjust the numbers acordingly.
